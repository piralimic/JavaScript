                    <p>After N seconds of inactivity (defined as the user not having navigated or switched away from the active tab) display a page action for that tab.</p><p>When the user clicks the page action, navigate to <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/stupid-homer-simpson-monkey-BBkKEBJkmFbTG/fullscreen">https://giphy.com/gifs/stupid-homer-simpson-monkey-BBkKEBJkmFbTG/fullscreen</a>.</p><p>"N" is set to 6 seconds in this example. Such a short period is chosen to make the extension's behavior more obvious, but this is not recommended in real life. Note that in Chrome, alarms cannot be set for less than a minute. In Chrome:</p><ul>
                      <li>if you install this extension "unpacked", you'll see a warning in the console, but the alarm will still go off after 6 seconds</li>
                      <li>if you package the extension and install it, then the alarm will go off after a minute.</li>
